I'm teaching myself how to write html/javascript. This is a very ugly implimentation, but I'm getting slightly better as I work my way through the project.
The basic idea is this. I have LED strips running along the underside of the table and along the edge of the ceiling in a room in my house. I also have a few radio frequency controlled electric outlets. They're already linked to a RaspberryPi, so I can control them through the GPIO pins.
I want a website to run on the Pi that can do the following:
* Display the status of the LEDs running under the table and along the ceiling
* Allows the user to change the color and intensity of the LEDs with an intuitive interface
* Allows the user to turn the RF electrical outlets on or off
